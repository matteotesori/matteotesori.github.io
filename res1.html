                        My research starts with my master thesis and is, at least for my PhD, mainly focused on tracking problems. 
                        In a classical tracking problem one is interested into estimate the positions (aka the "track") of a moving object given some observations of 
                        its position (or velocity) generated by a <abbr title="i.e. the sensor does not exachange information with the tracked object">non-cooperative</abbr> sensor,
                        such as a ground-based radar. By far, the most common solution is provided by the [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalman_filter">Kalman f&zwnj;ilter</a>], which is an iterative
                        algorithm that is characterized by some very nice properties:
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>1)</b> easy to understand and to implement on a computer;</li>
                            <li><b>2)</b> negligible computational cost, which allows the implementation in many real-time applications;</li>
                            <li><b>3)</b> allows to f&zwnj;ilter out (from here the term "f&zwnj;ilter") the inevitable noise detrementing the accuracy of the observations;</li>
                            <li><b>4)</b> allows to easily <abbr title="here ''fuse'' means ''produce the estimates given simultaneously all the observations provided by the different sensors'' ">fuse</abbr> multiple observations, not necessarily uncorrelated, provided by dif&zwnj;ferent sensors.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                        These reasons clearly explains the 60+ years of success of the Kalman f&zwnj;ilter and why nowdays the state-of-the-art trackers are still 
                         based on such algorithm.
                        However, in its standard conception, the Kalman f&zwnj;ilter does not take into account some important phenomena which cannot be neglected in many real-world applications and remarkably increase the dif&zwnj;f&zwnj;iculty of the tracking problem, for example:       
                        <ul style="margin-bottom: 8px;">
                            <li><b>1)</b> not just a single one, but rather multiple objects (which one must track all of them!) can be simultaneously present in the f&zwnj;ield of view of the sensor;</li>
                            <li><b>2)</b> if an object is close to the sensor then there is a good chance that the sensor can detect multiple ref&zwnj;lection points of such object - especially in the [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lidar">LIDAR</a>] case;</li>
                            <li><b>3)</b> the f&zwnj;ield of view of the sensor can be partially occluded, meaning that some objects can be present in the f&zwnj;ield of view but not detected at the same time;</li>
                            <li><b>4)</b> multiple spurious objects (which one does not want track!) can be present in the f&zwnj;ield of view of the sensor and detected.</li>
                        </ul>
                        In my master thesis I've spent a lot of time studying how to deal with these phenomena, ending up in a completely new, harsh and beautiful mathematical world that is unknown to the vast majority of engineering students (just like me).
                        This world, mainly developed by [<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37324055500">Ronald Mahler</a>] et al. in the early 90s, is called [<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1263231">FISST</a>] (Finite Set Statistics) and is based on the idea
                        of representing the objects and the sensor observations in terms of random f&zwnj;inite sets of random vectors (rather than random vectors - like in the classical approach).   
                        Despite is a quite new theory, the mathematic behind FISST is well-established. Indeed, FISST is nothing but more than an engineering-friendly distillation of the well-known and 
                        mature theory of the [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_process">point processes</a>], where, for the sake of simplicity, Mahler et al. have discharged all the unnecessary and pedantic mathematical details. 
                        However, FISST still remains a theory that requires a lot of work to be understood (40 hours of work per week for 6 months - in my case).
